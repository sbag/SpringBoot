### Introduction

Spring Boot has a lot of magic going for it. 

Developing applications with it is cool and fun.

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can “just run”. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

In this course, you will learn the cool things about Spring Boot and Spring Boot Starter Projects. We will develop 
- A web application to manage your todos
- A basic REST Service to manage questions of a survey

You will learn about Spring Boot step by step - in more than 90 steps. This course would be a perfect first step as an introduction to Spring Boot.

Here is a quick overview of different sections of the course:
- Introduction to Spring in 10 Steps
- Introduction to the power of Spring Boot in 10 Steps
- Develop a Todo Management Web Application in 30 Steps
- Introduction to Unit Testing with JUnit in 5 Steps 
- Introduction to Mocking with Mockito in 5 Steps
- Advanced Features of Spring Boot in 25 Steps - We learn these developing a simple API for managing survey questionnaire.
- Introduction to JPA in 10 Steps
- Connecting our Todo Management Web Application to JPA

You will be using REST Services, Spring (Dependency Management), Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization), BootStrap (Styling Pages), Maven (dependencies management), Eclipse (IDE) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server. We will help you set up each one of these. 

You will learn about
- Basics of Spring Boot
- Basics of Auto Configuration and Spring Boot Magic
- Spring Boot Starter Projects
- Spring Initializr
- DispatcherServlet
- Basic Todo Management Application with Login/Logout
- Model, Controllers, ViewResolver and Filters
- Forms - DataBinding, Validation
- Annotation based approach - @RequestParam, @ModelAttribute, @SessionAttributes etc
- Bootstrap to style the page
- Basic REST Services using Spring Boot Starter Web
- REST Service Content Negotiation with JSON and XML
- Embedded servlet containers : Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow
- Writing Unit and Integration tests using Spring Boot Starter Test
- Profiles and Dynamic Configuration with Spring Boot
- Spring Boot Data JPA
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Spring Security
- Spring Boot Developer Tools and LiveReload

### Goals
- Provide quick start for projects with Spring.
- Be opinionated but provide options.
- Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration).
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.


### Step Wise Details
Refer each steps

### Expectations
- You should know Java. You should understand usage of Annotations.
- A basic understanding of Spring is a bonus but NOT mandatory. We have seperate sections to introduce Spring.
- A basic understanding of JPA, Spring Security will be useful.
- You are NOT expected to have any experience with Eclipse or Maven.
- We will help you install Eclipse and get up and running with Maven.

## About in28Minutes
- At in28Minutes, we ask ourselves one question everyday. How do we help you learn effectively - that is more quickly and retain more of what you have learnt?
- We use Problem-Solution based Step-By-Step Hands-on Approach With Practical, Real World Application Examples. 
- Our success on Udemy and Youtube (2 Million Views & 12K Subscribers) speaks volumes about the success of our approach.
- While our primary expertise is on Development, Design & Architecture Java & Related Frameworks (Spring, Struts, Hibernate) we are expanding into the front-end world (Bootstrap, JQuery, Angular JS). 

### Our Beliefs
- Best Courses are interactive and fun.
- Foundations for building high quality applications are best laid down while learning.

### Our Approach
- Problem Solution based Step by Step Hands-on Learning
- Practical, Real World Application Examples.
- We use 80-20 Rule. We discuss 20% things used 80% of time in depth. We touch upon other things briefly equipping you with enough knowledge to find out more on your own. 
- We will be developing a demo application in the course, which could be reused in your projects, saving hours of your effort.
- We love open source and therefore, All our code is open source too and available on Github.
